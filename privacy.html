        <h2>5. Mobile Messaging and IVR-Specific Practices</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>5.1 Consent and Opt-In</h3>
            <p>Business Clients are responsible for obtaining all legally required consent from End Users before sending them calls, SMS/MMS messages, or automated communications through RoofSig.</p>
            <p>RoofSig may provide technical features to support consent capture, logging, and opt-out handling but does not verify the sufficiency of any consent.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Opt-Out and Preferences</h3>
            <p>End Users may typically opt out of SMS communications by replying with STOP or similar recognized keywords, as configured by the Business Client.</p>
            <p>When RoofSig's systems detect a valid opt-out command, RoofSig will flag the associated number as opted out for that specific program and will not send further messages through that program except where required for confirmation or legal compliance.</p>
            <p>Business Clients are responsible for aligning their use of RoofSig's tools with applicable opt-out obligations.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Content of Messages and Calls</h3>
            <p>The content of messages and IVR flows is determined by Business Clients.</p>
            <p>RoofSig processes these communications as a service provider and does not routinely review all content.</p>
            <p>RoofSig may access content and logs for troubleshooting, security, compliance checks, or as required by law.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>6.1 Core Principle for Mobile Numbers and Messaging Consent</h3>
            <p>RoofSig follows this principle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No mobile information will be shared with or sold to third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes.</li>
                <li>Information may be shared with subcontractors and service providers strictly to support the Services (for example, telecommunications, hosting, or customer support).</li>
                <li>All other use case categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with or sold to any third parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This principle applies to mobile numbers, opt-in status, and SMS/MMS consent data collected via RoofSig's Mobile Messaging Services. Any sharing is limited to service provisioning, compliance, and support operations.</p>

            <h3>6.2 Sharing with Business Clients</h3>
            <p><strong>For End Users:</strong></p>
            <p>If you are an End User communicating with a Business Client, RoofSig may share your relevant communication details (e.g., phone number, message content, call logs, booking details) with that Business Client, because they are the party you are dealing with directly.</p>
            <p>Business Clients control how they further use or disclose such information, subject to their own privacy policies and applicable laws.</p>
