            <h3>8.1 Term</h3>
            <p>These Terms are effective as of the earliest of: (a) the date Customer first accesses the Services; or (b) the effective date of the first Order Form, and continue until all Order Forms have expired or been terminated.</p>

            <h3>8.2 Subscription Term</h3>
            <p>Each Order Form specifies its initial Subscription Term. Subscriptions renew automatically for successive terms (e.g., month-to-month or annually) unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least [30] days before the end of the then-current term.</p>

            <h3>8.3 Termination for Cause</h3>
            <p>Either party may terminate an Order Form or these Terms upon written notice if:</p>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>(a) presents an immediate security or legal risk;</li>
                <li>(b) violates carrier or industry rules in a way that threatens service to other customers;</li>

            <p>Upon termination or expiration of a Subscription Term:</p>

            <h3>10.1 Customer Data Ownership</h3>
            <p>As between the parties, Customer retains all rights, title, and interest in and to Customer Data. RoofSig does not claim ownership of Customer Data.</p>

            <h3>10.2 License to Customer Data</h3>
            <p>Customer grants RoofSig a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, transmit, and use Customer Data solely as necessary to:</p>

RoofSig may use Service Data, and may create aggregated and/or anonymized data from Customer Data and Service Data, for internal analytics, monitoring, security, and product improvement, and for benchmarking or reporting, provided that such data does not identify Customer or End Users.</p>

            <h3>10.4 End User Personal Data</h3>
            <p>Customer acknowledges that the Services process personal data of End Users (e.g., phone numbers, call details, SMS content). Customer is the "business" or "controller" with respect to End User data under applicable US/Canadian privacy laws, and RoofSig acts as a "service provider" or "processor" solely on behalf of Customer. RoofSig will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) process End User data only as necessary to provide the Services and as instructed in writing by Customer;</li>
                <li>(b) not sell or share End User personal data for cross-context behavioral advertising or unrelated marketing;</li>

            <h3>10.5 Security Measures</h3>
            <p>RoofSig will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data, including access controls, encryption in transit where technically appropriate, and regular monitoring of core infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>10.6 Data Incidents</h3>
            <p>If RoofSig becomes aware of a security incident that materially compromises the confidentiality or integrity of Customer Data within RoofSig's systems, RoofSig will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) notify Customer without undue delay;</li>
                <li>(b) provide reasonably available information about the nature and scope of the incident;</li>
                <li>(c) take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate and remediate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Customer is responsible for incident notifications required by law to End Users or regulators, unless otherwise specified in a separate data processing addendum.</p>

            <h3>10.7 Data Processing Addendum</h3>
            <p>Upon Customer's written request, RoofSig may execute a separate data processing addendum ("DPA") that includes Standard Contractual Clauses or other mechanisms required by applicable privacy laws. Any such DPA will supplement, but not replace, the data processing terms in Section 10. In the event of conflict between a DPA and these Terms, the DPA governs solely with respect to the specific data processing obligations addressed therein.</p>

            <p>If Customer or its Authorized Users provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback regarding the Services ("Feedback"), RoofSig may use and exploit such Feedback without restriction or obligation, including to improve the Services, provided that RoofSig does not identify Customer publicly without consent.</p>

            <h3>11.3 Marks</h3>
            <p>Customer may use RoofSig's name and logo solely as reasonably necessary to identify RoofSig as Customer's technology provider, subject to any brand use guidelines.
