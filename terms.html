        <h1>Messaging Terms of Service</h1>
        <div class="last-updated">Last updated: November 21, 2025</div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>These Mobile Messaging Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of any SMS, MMS, or other text messaging programs (the "Messaging Program") operated by RoofSig LLC ("RoofSig," "we," "us," or "our"), including programs we operate on behalf of our business customers (such as roofing contractors and other service businesses) using telephone numbers provisioned via third-party messaging providers.</p>
            <p>By enrolling in, using, or interacting with the Messaging Program, you agree to these Terms.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Program Description</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>1.1</h3>
            <p>The RoofSig Messaging Program delivers text messages on behalf of participating businesses (for example, roofing contractors and other service providers) for purposes including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Responding to inbound inquiries and missed calls</li>
                <li>Confirming and rescheduling appointments</li>
                <li>Providing service updates (e.g., appointment reminders, technician en route notifications)</li>
                <li>Requesting feedback and online reviews after completed jobs</li>
                <li>Providing limited customer support information via SMS</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2</h3>
            <p>Messages will be sent from telephone numbers provisioned by RoofSig on behalf of participating businesses. The specific sending number(s) will be disclosed to you at the point of opt-in and will appear as the sender in all messages you receive.</p>

            <h3>1.3</h3>
            <p>Messages may be sent using automated technology, including auto-dialers and messaging platforms, where permitted by law. Message content will be informational and transactional in nature and may include links to websites or review pages.</p>

            <h3>1.4</h3>
            <p>Message frequency will vary depending on your interaction with the participating business (for example, more messages during active job scheduling and fewer messages after completion). Where required, specific frequency ranges (such as "up to X msgs/month") will be disclosed at the point of opt-in.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Consent and Opt-In</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>2.1</h3>
            <p>You may opt in to receive messages in one or more of the following ways, depending on the participating business's implementation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing your mobile number on a web form and affirmatively agreeing to receive messages</li>
                <li>Providing your mobile number over the phone and verbally agreeing to receive messages</li>
                <li>Texting a keyword to a designated phone number</li>
                <li>Responding to an automated phone prompt (IVR) during or after a call to the business, where you affirmatively agree to receive text messages by pressing a designated key (e.g., pressing 1 to receive appointment options via SMS)</li>
                <li>When you call a Business Client's phone number and the call is missed, Business Client may send you an initial SMS response to your inquiry under an established business relationship. Continuing the conversation via SMS (by replying with appointment preferences) constitutes your affirmative consent to receive appointment-related messages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2</h3>
            <p>By opting in, you represent that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are the primary account holder or authorized user of the mobile number provided</li>
                <li>You are at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction</li>
                <li>You understand that consent is not a condition of any purchase where such a statement is required by law</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3</h3>
            <p>Consent applies only to the specific program and brand for which it was obtained and is not sold, rented, or shared for unrelated third-party messaging lists.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Opt-Out Instructions</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>3.1</h3>
            <p>You can cancel the SMS service at any time by replying with the keyword STOP to any message you receive from the program's sending number.</p>

            <h3>3.2</h3>
            <p>After you send STOP, we will send you a single confirmation SMS that you have been unsubscribed. After that, you will no longer receive messages from that program.</p>

            <h3>3.3</h3>
            <p>If you wish to rejoin, you may re-opt in via the same mechanism you originally used (for example, signing up on a website or texting a keyword again).</p>

            <h3>3.4</h3>
            <p>You may also opt out by contacting the applicable business directly using their published phone number or contact form; they may submit your opt-out request into the RoofSig system.</p>

            <h3>3.5</h3>
            <p>Reasonable variations in your opt-out reply (such as "stop," "end," "cancel," "quit," or "unsubscribe") will be treated as a valid opt-out wherever technically and legally feasible.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Customer Care / Support</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>4.1</h3>

            </ul>
            <p>Mobile information collected through the Messaging Program (including your phone number and message content) will not be sold, rented, or shared with third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes.

            <h3>8.4 Security</h3>
